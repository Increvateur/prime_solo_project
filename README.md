<h1>Prime Solo Project</h1>

<h2>Manga Reader App</h2>

This is an app I am currently working on that will allow a user to visit the site and read their favorite manga series.

Using AngularJS and Angular Mobile UI, it is designed for viewing on a desktop / laptop computer and a mobile device such as a tablet. Currently it is not designed for use on mobile phones though it may work just fine.

<h2>Future Development</h2>

There are a number of items I am looking forward to adding in the future.

<ul>
  <li>Login / Logout Capabilities</li>
  <li>Search through available manga series on the site.</li>
  <li>Profile page for users.</li>
  <li>Being able to add certain series to a "Favorites" list.</li>
  <li>Keeping track of users' last page viewed if they are logged in.</li>
  <li>Switch the design over to Angular Material and away from Mobile Angular UI</li>
</ul>
